# Dvorak

My custom dvorak keyboard made from a programmer Dvorak :
  - french accents added
  - numbers reordered
  - ctrl keys on azerty emplacements (still good old ctrl+c, ctrl+v for example)

TODO :
  - two ":" exists, change one of them for something else
  - money symbols missing
  - "~" letters missing
  - bunch of empty letters on alt gr to be fulfilled
